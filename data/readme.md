Spectra used in the paper. The files contain 3 column: wavelength [A], normalised flux and normalised 1-sigma error.

The spectra were co-added from spectra of 22 individual exposures (see Section 2.3 *Velocity offsets and co-added spectra*).

The 22 exposures were corrected for velocity off-sets (see `voffset` folder) before being co-added ([wspectrum](https://github.com/ezavarygin/wspectrum) software was used for co-adding).

Note, careful cleansing the cosmic rays was done only for the wavelength ranges used in this work (Table 2).
